# Universal Viewer

implementing [Universal Viewer](https://universalviewer.io) in ArchivesSpace

If you have any other plugins with jQuery dependencies, UV's jQuery will break them. Be aware of that if you try to use this.

I'm sure when the HM implementation of a IIIF viewer ships it will resolve a lot of those conflicts and I won't need this anymore, but I got tired of waiting for that :)
